# Flutter Rules (FVM + Mobile)

See `COMMON_RULES.md` for rules that apply to all languages.

## Core principles

1. Flutter's core principle: Composition over inheritance - small, focused widgets
2. Testability: Each widget can be tested in isolation
3. Single Responsibility: One widget = one job
4. Reusability: Components can be used elsewhere
5. Readability: Smaller files (~100-200 lines) are easier to maintain
6. Follow SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion)

## Documentation Comments

Use `///` doc comments on all public classes, methods, and properties:

```dart
/// Service responsible for user authentication.
class AuthService {
  /// Attempts to log in with the given [email] and [password].
  ///
  /// Returns the authenticated [User] on success.
  /// Throws [AuthException] if credentials are invalid.
  Future<User> login(String email, String password) async {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Rules:
- Every public class, method, and property must have a `///` comment
- Use `[paramName]` to reference parameters in doc comments
- Keep descriptions concise; one sentence for simple members
- Do not use `//` block comments for documentation

---

## When to Use `part` / `part of`

Prefer normal `import` / `export` for all hand-written code. Do **not** use `part`
to split large classes, organize features into folders, or share utilities — it
hides dependencies, weakens encapsulation (all `part` files share one private
scope), and makes refactoring harder.

Use `part` only when:

1. **Code generation requires it** — the common modern case. Generators emit into
   `*.g.dart` / `*.freezed.dart` files included via `part`:

   ```dart
   import 'package:json_annotation/json_annotation.dart';

   part 'user.g.dart';

   @JsonSerializable()
   class User {
     final String name;
     User(this.name);
     factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$UserFromJson(json);
     Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => _$UserToJson(this);
   }
   ```

   Applies to `freezed`, `json_serializable`, `objectbox` (`objectbox.g.dart`), and
   similar — see the JSON Serialization and Database (ObjectBox) sections.

2. **One tightly-coupled library** (rare) — several files that genuinely form a
   single library and must share library-private (`_`) members.

| Scenario                                   | Use `part`? |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Application / widget code                  | No          |
| Splitting a large class across files       | No          |
| Organizing features or modules             | No          |
| Generated files (`freezed`, `*.g.dart`)    | Yes         |
| One tightly-coupled library impl           | Sometimes   |

Rule of thumb: **if you write the code, use imports/exports; if a generator
requires it, use `part`.**

---

## Mixins

Mixins share behavior across classes that do **not** share an inheritance chain.
Reach for a mixin only when composition (a plain helper class injected via `GetIt`,
or a field) does not fit — Flutter favors composition over inheritance, and a
mixin is a form of inheritance.

### Rules

1. **Use the `mixin` keyword, never a `class` as a mixin.** A `mixin` cannot be
   instantiated or extended, which documents intent and prevents misuse. Use
   `mixin class` only in the rare case a type must serve as both — never by default.

2. **Constrain with `on` whenever the mixin depends on a host type.** This both
   restricts where the mixin can be applied and grants typed access to the host's
   members. Prefer `mixin AnalyticsLogging on State` over an unconstrained mixin
   that assumes a `context`.

3. **Keep mixins stateless.** All `part`/mixin members live in the host's scope, so
   a mutable field in a mixin silently couples to — and can collide with — the
   host's fields. If state is unavoidable, prefix fields with `_`, document the
   ownership, and keep it to one field.

4. **One capability per mixin (single responsibility).** A mixin named for a
   behavior (`Disposable`, `Validatable`) is good; a `UtilsMixin` grab-bag is not.

5. **Name by capability**, ending in `-able` or with a `Mixin` suffix, matching the
   existing `SearchableMixin` convention. Be consistent within a project.

6. **Only call `super.method()` when the `on` constraint guarantees it exists.**
   Mixins are linearized left-to-right; later mixins override earlier ones. Know the
   apply order when overriding lifecycle methods (e.g. `initState`/`dispose`).

7. **Mark host-only members `@protected`** and give every public member a `///`
   doc comment, per the Documentation Comments rules.

8. **Do not use a mixin to share code that could be a standalone service.** If the
   behavior owns state or has dependencies, make it a class and inject it with
   `GetIt` — see Dependency Injection.

Legit Flutter framework mixins — `TickerProviderStateMixin`,
`AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin`, `WidgetsBindingObserver` — model all of the above:
host-constrained, behavior-focused, named by capability.

### When to use a mixin vs. the alternative

| Need                                                    | Use                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Share stateless behavior across unrelated classes       | `mixin`                      |
| Add behavior that needs a specific host (`State`, etc.) | `mixin ... on HostType`      |
| Share behavior that owns state or dependencies          | Class + `GetIt` (composition)|
| Define a contract only (no implementation)              | `abstract interface class`   |
| Reuse one widget's look/structure                       | Compose widgets, not a mixin |

Rule of thumb: **a mixin adds behavior, not state.** If you find yourself storing
data in a mixin, it should probably be a class you inject instead.

## Flutter Version Management

Use FVM (Flutter Version Manager) for all projects. Create `.fvmrc` in the project root:

```json
{
  "flutter": "3.44.0"
}
```

Latest verified stable as of 2026-05-26. Confirm with `fvm releases --channel stable` for new projects.

All Flutter commands should be prefixed with `fvm`:

```bash
fvm flutter pub get
fvm flutter run
fvm flutter build apk
```

---

## Localization

Use the `flutter_i18n_translations` library for multi-language support:
https://github.com/BenjaminKobjolke/flutter-i18n-translations

### Installation

Add to `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_i18n_translations:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/BenjaminKobjolke/flutter-i18n-translations.git
```

Then run:

```bash
fvm flutter pub get
```

### Directory Structure

```
project/
├── assets/
│   └── i18n/
│       ├── en.json         # English (default)
│       ├── de.json         # German
│       └── languages.json  # Language metadata
├── lib/
│   ├── config/
│   │   ├── constants.dart
│   │   └── translation_keys.dart
│   └── main.dart
└── pubspec.yaml
```

### Configure Assets

In `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/i18n/
```

### Translation File Format

Create `assets/i18n/en.json`:

```json
{
  "app": {
    "name": "My Application",
    "welcome": "Welcome, {name}!"
  },
  "nav": {
    "dashboard": "Dashboard",
    "settings": "Settings",
    "logout": "Logout"
  },
  "auth": {
    "login_title": "Login",
    "signin_subtitle": "Sign in to access your dashboard",
    "error": {
      "auth_failed": "Authentication failed. Please try again.",
      "rate_limited": "Too many attempts. Please try again later."
    }
  },
  "common": {
    "cancel": "Cancel",
    "save": "Save",
    "delete": "Delete",
    "edit": "Edit"
  }
}
```

Create `assets/i18n/languages.json`:

```json
{
  "en": "English",
  "de": "Deutsch"
}
```

### Initialization

In `main.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_i18n_translations/flutter_i18n_translations.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  // Initialize localization
  final localizationService = LocalizationService();
  final languageCode = await determineSystemLanguage();
  await localizationService.load(languageCode);
  AppLocalizations.init(localizationService);

  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

### Usage in Widgets

```dart
import 'package:flutter_i18n_translations/flutter_i18n_translations.dart';
import 'package:myapp/config/translation_keys.dart';

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        // Simple translation
        Text(AppLocalizations.tr(TK.appName)),

        // With parameters
        Text(AppLocalizations.tr(TK.appWelcome,
          params: {'name': 'John'}
        )),

        // Get current language
        Text('Current: ${AppLocalizations.currentLanguage}'),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

---

## Translation Key Naming Convention

Use dot notation with logical grouping:

```
section.subsection.key

app.name               - Application info
nav.dashboard          - Navigation items
auth.login_title       - Authentication related
auth.error.auth_failed - Nested error messages
common.save            - Reusable UI elements
```

---

## Translation Keys as Constants

Using raw strings like `AppLocalizations.tr('nav.dashboard')` is error-prone. Create a `TK` class with all keys as constants for IDE autocomplete and compile-time checking.

Create `lib/config/translation_keys.dart`:

```dart
// lib/config/translation_keys.dart
class TK {
  TK._();

  // App
  static const String appName = 'app.name';
  static const String appWelcome = 'app.welcome';

  // Navigation
  static const String navDashboard = 'nav.dashboard';
  static const String navSettings = 'nav.settings';
  static const String navLogout = 'nav.logout';

  // Auth
  static const String authLoginTitle = 'auth.login_title';
  static const String authSigninSubtitle = 'auth.signin_subtitle';
  static const String authErrorAuthFailed = 'auth.error.auth_failed';
  static const String authErrorRateLimited = 'auth.error.rate_limited';

  // Common
  static const String commonCancel = 'common.cancel';
  static const String commonSave = 'common.save';
  static const String commonDelete = 'common.delete';
  static const String commonEdit = 'common.edit';
}
```

Usage:

```dart
import 'package:myapp/config/translation_keys.dart';

// Instead of:
AppLocalizations.tr('nav.dashboard');

// Use:
AppLocalizations.tr(TK.navDashboard);
```

### Benefits

- IDE autocomplete for all translation keys
- Compile-time error if constant doesn't exist
- Easy to find all usages of a key
- Refactoring support

### Detecting unused or missing keys

Every Flutter project that uses the `TK` pattern **must** ship tooling that
detects all of the following:

1. TK constants whose i18n path does not exist (broken at runtime).
2. TK constants with no callers (dead Dart code).
3. i18n leaves with no TK constant pointing at them (orphan translations).
4. Raw `AppLocalizations.tr('literal')` calls that bypass the TK class.

Reference implementation: `tools/check_translation_keys.dart` +
`tools/check_translation_keys.bat`, shipped in `flutter_setup_files/tools/`.
Run the audit whenever a TK constant or i18n key is added or removed, and
do not consider the change complete while the audit reports any issue. The
`--fix` flag auto-substitutes matchable raw literals **and** auto-creates
TK constants for raw literals that already have a matching i18n leaf;
remaining "broken" entries (raw literal whose i18n leaf is missing too)
must be resolved by hand.

Copy the whole set — the three scripts below plus `translation_key_audit.dart`
and the `.bat` wrappers. Only two constants in `check_translation_keys.dart`
are per-project: `_topKeyToClass` (top-level i18n key → owning `TK*` class)
and `_packageName`.

Companion tooling lives next to the audit script:

- `translation_key_audit.dart` — the shared detector every script imports.
  Layout, TK parsing, and the caller scan live here so a pruner can never
  drift from the audit and delete keys the audit considers live.
- `prune_unused_translation_keys.dart` — deletes dead TK constants from
  `lib/config/translation_keys/tk_*.dart`. Safe because the audit
  guarantees zero references. Drops only the declaration lines, leaving the
  rest of the file byte-identical.
- `prune_orphan_i18n_leaves.dart` — removes i18n leaves no caller
  references (TK or raw literal). When `tools/attributes_to_remove.json`
  exists, removed paths are merged into it so a translator batch can strip
  them from locale files the script does not own; projects without that
  batch never create the file.
- `split_translation_keys.dart` — when the project's `TK` class grows past
  ~500 lines, split it into one `TKModule` class per top-level i18n key
  group with a barrel re-export. The split keeps every existing
  `TK.foo`-style call site valid after a one-shot codemod.

Two detection rules exist because a naive audit reports false positives on
both, and a pruner acting on them destroys working code:

- **`...Prefix` constants.** A constant whose name ends in `Prefix` holds a
  partial path completed at runtime — `tr('${TKStats.weekStatusPrefix}$s')`.
  It is treated as matching any leaf below its value, so it is not "missing"
  and the leaves it reaches are not orphans.
- **The `_tr` wrapper.** Widgets commonly define
  `String _tr(String key) => AppLocalizations.tr(key);` and call `_tr(...)`.
  The raw-literal scan matches both spellings; matching only
  `AppLocalizations.tr` makes category 4 blind to most of the codebase.

Both i18n layouts are auto-detected at startup — modular
(`assets/i18n/modules.json` + `assets/i18n/<module>/<locale>.json`) and
single-file (`assets/i18n/<locale>.json`). Locales come from
`assets/i18n/languages.json`.

---

## Language Switching

```dart
// Get available languages
final languages = AppLocalizations.getAvailableLanguages(); // ['de', 'en']

// Get language display name
final displayName = AppLocalizations.getLanguageName('de'); // "Deutsch"

// Switch language
await localizationService.load('de');
// Rebuild UI (e.g., restart app or use state management)
```

### Persisting Language Choice

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

Future<void> changeLanguage(String languageCode) async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.setString('language', languageCode);
  await localizationService.load(languageCode);
}

// On app start
final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
final savedLanguage = prefs.getString('language');
final languageCode = savedLanguage ?? await determineSystemLanguage();
```

---

## Adding New Languages

1. Copy `assets/i18n/en.json` to `assets/i18n/de.json`
2. Translate all values (keep keys identical)
3. Update `assets/i18n/languages.json`:

```json
{
  "en": "English",
  "de": "Deutsch"
}
```

## Project Setup Scripts

Copy the setup batch files from the `flutter_setup_files/` folder bundled with the
coding-rules plugin (next to this rules file).

### install.bat

Initial project setup:

- Checks if FVM is installed
- Runs `fvm install` to install Flutter version
- Runs `fvm flutter pub get` to install dependencies
- Runs tests to verify setup

### update.bat

Update all dependencies:

- Updates dependencies with `fvm flutter pub upgrade`
- Runs `fvm flutter analyze` for linting
- Runs tests to verify compatibility

### tools/run_tests.bat

Run the test suite:

- Runs `fvm flutter test`, redirected to a temp file so the script captures
  flutter test's own exit code before anything else touches it
- Shows pass/fail summary based on that captured exit code, then `exit /b`s
  with it
- If you add noise filtering for third-party log spam, filter the temp file
  with PowerShell `Select-String -NotMatch` (see comment in the bat) - never
  pipe `fvm flutter test` straight into `findstr`. The pipe's exit code
  becomes the filter's exit code, not flutter test's, so a real failure can
  silently read as a pass (or vice versa). `findstr` also has a ~8191-char
  line-length limit and errors on long compact-reporter lines, tripping the
  same bug even harder.

### tools/build_debug.bat

Build debug APK:

- Runs `fvm flutter build apk --debug`
- Shows output location

### tools/build_release.bat

Build release APK:

- Runs `fvm flutter build apk --release`
- Shows output location

### Usage

```bash
# First time setup
install.bat

# Run tests
tools\run_tests.bat

# Build debug APK
tools\build_debug.bat

# Build release APK
tools\build_release.bat

# Update dependencies
update.bat
```

## Approved Libraries

Before implementing any new feature, **check
[`flutter_setup_files/LIBRARIES.md`](flutter_setup_files/LIBRARIES.md)** — it lists the approved
third-party libraries, their confirmed versions, and a reference implementation for each.

- If a listed library already covers the job, use it. Do not hand-roll an equivalent and do not
  introduce a competing package for the same concern.
- If nothing listed covers it, confirm the version with the user (see `COMMON_RULES.md` →
  "Confirm Dependency Versions"), then add the library to `LIBRARIES.md` with a pointer to the
  first real implementation, so the next project picks it up automatically.

This is the same "check before you build" rule as `COMMON_RULES.md` → "Reusable Tooling",
applied to dependencies instead of scripts.

---

## App Icons

Whenever icons are involved — setting up a new project's launcher icon, replacing
existing art, adding a notification icon, or debugging one that renders wrong —
**read [`flutter_setup_files/ICONS.md`](flutter_setup_files/ICONS.md) first.**

House style is a **solid black background with simple white line art**. The guide
covers why (an adaptive icon's background layer must be opaque, so transparent is
not an option), the source-art layout, the `flutter_launcher_icons` config, and
the separate white-on-transparent notification icon Android needs — pointing a
notification at the launcher icon renders a featureless white blob in the status
bar.

Each project records its own paths and wiring in `docs/ICONS.md`.

---

# Essential Rules

## 1) Use `pubspec.yaml` as the single source of truth

Keep all dependencies and configuration in `pubspec.yaml`.

Recommended baseline:

- Flutter/Dart SDK version constraints
- Dependencies managed via `fvm flutter pub add ...`
- Lock file committed: `pubspec.lock`

### Standard Dependencies

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  # Localization
  flutter_i18n_translations:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/BenjaminKobjolke/flutter-i18n-translations.git

  # HTTP
  dio: ^5.9.0

  # Database
  objectbox: ^5.1.0

  # Utilities
  path_provider: ^2.1.0
  path: ^1.9.0
  shared_preferences: ^2.2.0

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lints: ^3.0.0

  # ObjectBox code generation
  objectbox_generator: ^5.1.0
  build_runner: ^2.4.0
```

---

## 2) Enforce linting and formatting

Use the standard Flutter analyzer:

```bash
fvm flutter analyze
fvm dart format lib/
```

Configure `analysis_options.yaml`:

```yaml
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  rules:
    prefer_const_constructors: true
    prefer_const_declarations: true
    avoid_print: true
```

---

## 3) Centralize configuration

No "magic values" in code. Use a config class:

```dart
// lib/config/app_config.dart
class AppConfig {
  AppConfig._();

  static const String apiBaseUrl = 'https://api.example.com';
  static const Duration requestTimeout = Duration(seconds: 30);
  static const bool debugMode = true;
}
```

### Sensitive Data

Never commit API keys, secrets, or credentials to version control. Use `.env` files for sensitive values:

1. Add `flutter_dotenv` to `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
API_KEY=your_secret_key_here
API_SECRET=your_secret_here
```

3. Add `.env` to `.gitignore`:

```
.env
```

4. Load in `main.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_dotenv/flutter_dotenv.dart';

void main() async {
  await dotenv.load(fileName: ".env");
  // Access values: dotenv.env['API_KEY']
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

5. Provide a `.env.example` file (committed) with placeholder values so other developers know which keys are required.

---

## 4) Logging & Error Handling

### Logging

Never use `print()` for logging. Use `dart:developer` or the `logger` package:

```dart
import 'dart:developer' as developer;

// Simple log
developer.log('User loaded successfully', name: 'UserService');

// Log with error
developer.log('Failed to load user', name: 'UserService', error: e, stackTrace: stackTrace);
```

Or with the `logger` package:

```yaml
dependencies:
  logger: ^2.0.0
```

```dart
import 'package:logger/logger.dart';

final logger = Logger();

logger.d('Debug message');
logger.i('Info message');
logger.w('Warning message');
logger.e('Error message', error: e, stackTrace: stackTrace);
```

#### Central Logger Class

Route all logging through one class named **`AppLogger`** (`app_logger.dart`). Never call
`print()`, `developer.log`, or the `logger` package directly from feature code — only
`AppLogger` wraps them. This gives a single enable/level toggle (e.g. `AppConfig.logLevel`)
without touching call sites.

```dart
AppLogger.d('Debug message');
AppLogger.i('User loaded', name: 'UserService');
AppLogger.e('Failed to load user', error: e, stackTrace: stackTrace);
```

### Error Handling

- Use try-catch for all async and critical operations
- Display user-friendly error messages in the UI (never show raw exceptions)
- Log errors with context (class name, method name, relevant parameters)

```dart
Future<void> loadUser(int userId) async {
  try {
    final user = await _userService.getUser(userId);
    emit(state.copyWith(user: user));
  } on DioException catch (e) {
    developer.log('Failed to load user $userId', name: 'UserCubit', error: e);
    emit(state.copyWith(errorMessage: AppLocalizations.tr(TK.errorLoadFailed)));
  }
}
```

---

## 5) Tests are mandatory

Use Flutter test framework:

```bash
fvm flutter test
```

Rules:

- Unit tests for services and business logic
- Widget tests for UI components
- No network in unit tests (use mocks)
- Run tests in CI on every push

---

## 6) Required Batch Files

Every project must include these batch files:

- `install.bat` - In the root directory, initial project setup
- `update.bat` - In the root directory, update dependencies
- `tools/run_tests.bat` - Runs the test suite
- `tools/build_debug.bat` - Builds debug APK
- `tools/build_release.bat` - Builds release APK

---

## 7) State Management (Cubit)

Use **Cubit** from the `flutter_bloc` package for state management. Cubit is the recommended approach for all Flutter projects.

### Why Cubit?

- **Simpler than BLoC**: No events, just methods that emit states
- **Predictable**: Clear separation between UI and business logic
- **Testable**: Easy to unit test state changes
- **Scalable**: Works for simple screens and complex apps alike
- **Less boilerplate**: Compared to full BLoC pattern

### Installation

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_bloc: ^8.1.0
  equatable: ^2.0.5  # For state comparison
```

```bash
fvm flutter pub get
```

### Basic Example

**State class** (`lib/cubits/counter_state.dart`):

```dart
import 'package:equatable/equatable.dart';

class CounterState extends Equatable {
  final int count;
  final bool isLoading;

  const CounterState({
    this.count = 0,
    this.isLoading = false,
  });

  CounterState copyWith({int? count, bool? isLoading}) {
    return CounterState(
      count: count ?? this.count,
      isLoading: isLoading ?? this.isLoading,
    );
  }

  @override
  List<Object?> get props => [count, isLoading];
}
```

**Cubit class** (`lib/cubits/counter_cubit.dart`):

```dart
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';
import 'counter_state.dart';

class CounterCubit extends Cubit<CounterState> {
  CounterCubit() : super(const CounterState());

  void increment() {
    emit(state.copyWith(count: state.count + 1));
  }

  void decrement() {
    emit(state.copyWith(count: state.count - 1));
  }

  Future<void> loadFromApi() async {
    emit(state.copyWith(isLoading: true));
    // Simulate API call
    await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 1));
    emit(state.copyWith(count: 42, isLoading: false));
  }
}
```

**Usage in Widget**:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';
import '../cubits/counter_cubit.dart';
import '../cubits/counter_state.dart';

class CounterScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const CounterScreen({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlocProvider(
      create: (_) => CounterCubit(),
      child: const CounterView(),
    );
  }
}

class CounterView extends StatelessWidget {
  const CounterView({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Counter')),
      body: BlocBuilder<CounterCubit, CounterState>(
        builder: (context, state) {
          if (state.isLoading) {
            return const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
          }
          return Center(
            child: Text('Count: ${state.count}'),
          );
        },
      ),
      floatingActionButton: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.end,
        children: [
          FloatingActionButton(
            onPressed: () => context.read<CounterCubit>().increment(),
            child: const Icon(Icons.add),
          ),
          const SizedBox(height: 8),
          FloatingActionButton(
            onPressed: () => context.read<CounterCubit>().decrement(),
            child: const Icon(Icons.remove),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Project Structure

```
lib/
├── cubits/
│   ├── counter_cubit.dart
│   ├── counter_state.dart
│   ├── auth_cubit.dart
│   └── auth_state.dart
├── screens/
│   └── counter_screen.dart
└── main.dart
```

### Key Patterns

- **One Cubit per feature/screen**: Keep cubits focused
- **Immutable states**: Always use `copyWith` pattern
- **Equatable**: Use for efficient state comparison
- **BlocProvider**: Provide cubits at the widget level
- **BlocBuilder**: Rebuild UI when state changes
- **BlocListener**: Handle side effects (navigation, snackbars)

## 8) HTTP Communication (Dio)

Use Dio for all HTTP communication.

### Installation

```bash
fvm flutter pub add dio
```

Add to `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dio: ^5.9.0
```

### API Client Singleton

Create `lib/services/api_client.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:myapp/config/app_config.dart';

class ApiClient {
  ApiClient._();

  static final Dio _dio = Dio(
    BaseOptions(
      baseUrl: AppConfig.apiBaseUrl,
      connectTimeout: AppConfig.requestTimeout,
      receiveTimeout: AppConfig.requestTimeout,
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Accept': 'application/json',
      },
    ),
  );

  static Dio get instance => _dio;
}
```

### Usage Example

```dart
import 'package:myapp/services/api_client.dart';

class UserService {
  final Dio _dio = ApiClient.instance;

  Future<Map<String, dynamic>> getUser(int id) async {
    final response = await _dio.get('/users/$id');
    return response.data;
  }

  Future<Map<String, dynamic>> createUser(Map<String, dynamic> data) async {
    final response = await _dio.post('/users', data: data);
    return response.data;
  }
}
```

### Error Handling

```dart
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';

Future<void> fetchData() async {
  try {
    final response = await ApiClient.instance.get('/data');
    // Handle success
  } on DioException catch (e) {
    switch (e.type) {
      case DioExceptionType.connectionTimeout:
      case DioExceptionType.receiveTimeout:
        // Handle timeout
        break;
      case DioExceptionType.badResponse:
        final statusCode = e.response?.statusCode;
        // Handle HTTP errors (400, 401, 404, 500, etc.)
        break;
      case DioExceptionType.connectionError:
        // Handle no internet
        break;
      default:
        // Handle other errors
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

## 9) Database (ObjectBox)

Use ObjectBox for local persistence.

### Installation

Add to `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  objectbox: ^5.1.0

dev_dependencies:
  objectbox_generator: ^5.1.0
  build_runner: ^2.4.0
```

Run:

```bash
fvm flutter pub get
fvm dart run build_runner build
```

### Entity Example

Create `lib/models/user.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:objectbox/objectbox.dart';

@Entity()
class User {
  @Id()
  int id = 0;

  String name;
  String email;

  @Property(type: PropertyType.date)
  DateTime createdAt;

  User({
    this.id = 0,
    required this.name,
    required this.email,
    DateTime? createdAt,
  }) : createdAt = createdAt ?? DateTime.now();
}
```

### ObjectBox Initialization

Create `lib/services/objectbox_service.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
import 'package:path/path.dart' as p;
import '../objectbox.g.dart';

class ObjectBoxService {
  ObjectBoxService._();

  static Store? _store;

  static Store get store {
    if (_store == null) {
      throw Exception('ObjectBox not initialized. Call init() first.');
    }
    return _store!;
  }

  static Future<void> init() async {
    if (_store != null) return;

    final dir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    final dbPath = p.join(dir.path, 'objectbox');
    _store = await openStore(directory: dbPath);
  }

  static void close() {
    _store?.close();
    _store = null;
  }
}
```

Initialize in `main.dart`:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  // Initialize ObjectBox
  await ObjectBoxService.init();

  // Initialize localization
  // ...

  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

### Basic CRUD Operations

```dart
import 'package:myapp/models/user.dart';
import 'package:myapp/services/objectbox_service.dart';
import '../objectbox.g.dart';

class UserRepository {
  final Box<User> _box = ObjectBoxService.store.box<User>();

  // Create or Update
  int put(User user) {
    return _box.put(user);
  }

  // Get by ID
  User? get(int id) {
    return _box.get(id);
  }

  // Get all
  List<User> getAll() {
    return _box.getAll();
  }

  // Delete
  bool delete(int id) {
    return _box.remove(id);
  }

  // Query
  List<User> findByName(String name) {
    final query = _box.query(User_.name.equals(name)).build();
    final results = query.find();
    query.close();
    return results;
  }
}
```

## 10) In-App Debugger (Logarte)

For debugging network requests and viewing logs directly on the device, use Logarte.

See the detailed integration guide: [In-App Debugger Documentation](flutter/IN_APP_DEBUGGER.md)

**Requirements:**
- Must be accessible from the Settings screen
- Must be enable/disable via `AppConfig.enableLogarte`

**Key features:**
- Network request logging (automatic with Dio interceptor)
- Navigation event logging
- Searchable log viewer
- Password protection for release builds
- Log sharing and export

---

## Dependency Injection

Use `GetIt` for service location and dependency injection. Register services at app startup and
retrieve them via `GetIt.instance`. This keeps services decoupled and testable.

---

## JSON Serialization

Use `freezed` + `json_serializable` for type-safe API models. This generates immutable data
classes with `fromJson`/`toJson` methods, `copyWith`, and equality out of the box.

---

## Widget Rebuild Optimization

Minimize unnecessary widget rebuilds to maintain smooth performance:

- Use `const` constructors wherever possible
- Extract subtrees into separate widgets to limit rebuild scope
- Avoid building large widget trees inside a single `build` method
- Use `BlocSelector` or `BlocBuilder` with `buildWhen` to rebuild only when relevant state changes

---

## Respect System Insets (SafeArea)

Screen-level content must never render underneath the system UI — the status bar,
the notch/cutout, or the bottom navigation/gesture bar. Otherwise bottom controls
(a Save button, an FAB, the last list item) sit partly behind the Android nav bar
and are hard or impossible to tap.

- **Wrap the `Scaffold` `body` in a `SafeArea`** for any screen whose content can
  reach a screen edge — especially scrollable bodies (`ListView`, `SingleChildScrollView`,
  `Column` with a bottom button). The `AppBar` already handles the top inset; the
  bottom inset is the one that bites.

  ```dart
  // Anti-pattern: bottom button scrolls under the nav bar
  body: ListView(padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16), children: [...]),

  // Correct: SafeArea insets the scroll view above the system bars
  body: SafeArea(
    child: ListView(padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16), children: [...]),
  ),
  ```

- `EdgeInsets` padding is **not** a substitute — a hardcoded padding value does not
  track the device's actual inset (varies by phone, gesture vs button nav, landscape).
- **Don't double-inset.** A `Scaffold` `appBar` already consumes the top inset; if you
  keep `SafeArea` defaults (`top: true`) under an `AppBar` it's harmless (inset is
  already zero there), but don't also add manual top padding on top of it.
- For a body behind a keyboard, `Scaffold.resizeToAvoidBottomInset` (default `true`)
  handles the keyboard; `SafeArea` handles the persistent system bars. They are
  separate concerns — keep both defaults on unless you have a reason not to.
- Full-bleed content (a background image, an edge-to-edge map) is the deliberate
  exception: opt out per-edge (`SafeArea(bottom: false, ...)`) rather than dropping
  `SafeArea` entirely, so only the intended edge bleeds.

---

## Self-Describing Classes

Implement the common "Self-Describing Classes" rule using an abstract class or mixin.

```dart
abstract class Searchable {
  /// Returns a map of field name to field value for all searchable fields.
  Map<String, String> getSearchableFields();
}

class Customer implements Searchable {
  final String name;
  final String email;
  final String phone;

  const Customer({required this.name, required this.email, required this.phone});

  @override
  Map<String, String> getSearchableFields() {
    return {'name': name, 'email': email, 'phone': phone};
  }
}
```

Alternatively, use a mixin when classes already have an inheritance hierarchy
(follow the [Mixins](#mixins) rules):

```dart
mixin SearchableMixin {
  Map<String, String> getSearchableFields();
}
```

---

## Mixins, Widgets, and Injected Services (Coupling)

Reinforces core principle #1 (Composition over inheritance) and
**Inject Collaborators, Don't Fold Dependencies In** in `COMMON_RULES.md`.

- **`with SomeMixin` folds the mixin's dependencies into the widget/class.** Stacking behavior
  mixins spreads their imports across the host. Prefer a child widget or an injected service
  (get_it / Provider / Riverpod) for anything that carries dependencies; keep mixins for small,
  dependency-free behavior.
- **A god `build()` method is a coupling sink.** A widget whose `build()` wires many services and
  passes values down through several constructor layers (prop-drilling) depends on everything it
  drills through. Extract child widgets, and pass a single config object or read shared state via
  `InheritedWidget` / a provider instead of threading many parameters.

```dart
// Anti-pattern: one widget builds everything and drills props through 3 layers
// Correct: extract InvoiceHeader / InvoiceActions child widgets; inject services via provider,
//          pass an InvoiceViewConfig value object instead of a dozen constructor params
```
