# graphify Knowledge Graph (Optional Addon)

graphify turns a code folder into a queryable knowledge graph — god nodes, communities,
cross-file relationships, fan-in/fan-out. Use it to orient before grep and to spot god classes.

**Keep the build AST-only (no LLM, no API cost) by scoping to the code dir.** graphify runs a
free deterministic AST pass on *code* files, but a separate **LLM pass** on every *non-code*
file — docs, `.md`, `.txt`, config `.yaml`, images (vision), audio/video (whisper). That pass
needs an LLM (Gemini key or the host agent) and costs tokens. A build scoped to a pure-code dir
(`lib/`, `src/`, `app/`) has zero non-code files, so it skips the LLM pass entirely and rebuilds
need no AI. A repo-root build (`/graphify .`) sweeps in `docs/`, `README.md`, icons, and sound
assets — forcing the LLM pass. **Always scope to the code dir; never build the repo root.**

Setup instructions live in the coding-rules plugin at `graphify_setup_files/SETUP.md`.

## Folder layout (know which is which)

- `graphify-out/` at the **project root** = the **live graph** (`graph.json`, `GRAPH_REPORT.md`,
  `graph.html`). The only one queries read. Keep it `directed=True`.
- `graphify-out/cache/` at the project root = AST cache written by the CLI refresh (it runs
  with `GRAPHIFY_OUT` pointing at the root folder, see "Refreshing"). Scratch only.
- `<code-dir>/graphify-out/` = legacy AST cache from the skill build. Never the live graph
  under the documented flow; safe to delete. If a `graph.json` ever appears in there, a bare
  `graphify update` ran without `GRAPHIFY_OUT` — delete that `graph.json`, keep `cache/`.

## What the graph knows (and does not)

- Knows: code structure — classes, methods, calls, references, extends/implements, plus
  fan-in/fan-out and community / god-node structure.
- Does NOT know: business rules, API response shape, or rendered template/view output. It is a
  snapshot — stale until rebuilt. Constants referenced by string can appear as isolated nodes
  (AST limitation, not a missing dependency).

---

## Using the graph

- For codebase questions, run `graphify query "<question>"` first when `graphify-out/graph.json`
  exists. `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships; `graphify explain "<concept>"` for a
  focused node. These return a small scoped subgraph vs. reading GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep.
- Judge coupling by direction: high **fan-in** + low fan-out (shared base / constants / DTO) is
  healthy; high **fan-out** (>~20 outgoing deps) is god-class risk and a refactor signal.
- Read `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` only for broad architecture review, or when
  query/path/explain do not surface enough context.

## Manual refresh bat (`tools/graphify_update.bat`)

Copied from the `graphify_update.bat` template beside this addon, adjusted (`CODE_DIR`).
Run it from anywhere — it `pushd`es to the repo root itself.

- **Does:** (1) the live-graph CLI refresh from "Refreshing after a code change" in
  `IMPLEMENTATION_FLOW.md` (sets `GRAPHIFY_OUT` to the root
  `graphify-out\`, passes the absolute code dir); (2) smoke test — prints the root
  graph's `directed` flag + node count, `god-nodes`, a sample `query`.
- **Does NOT:** re-extract docs (see "Doc changes" in `IMPLEMENTATION_FLOW.md`) or build a first graph — that is the
  skill flow (`/graphify <code-dir> --directed`).
- **When to use:** after a code change outside an AI session, or as a "is graphify still
  wired up?" check after cloning, a dependency change, or a graphify upgrade.

## In-tree vendored code — exclude it, scoping alone won't

`--directed`-scoping the build to `<code-dir>` keeps external `vendor/`/`node_modules/` out
automatically, but a **committed** third-party library living *inside* `<code-dir>` (a bundled
SDK, a copied library folder) is not gitignored, so graphify scans it like first-party code.
Symptom: god-nodes / oversized communities in `GRAPH_REPORT.md` whose class names belong to a
library, not the app (e.g. hundreds of `Facebook*`/`GraphNode*` nodes from an in-tree Facebook
SDK).

Fix once per project:

1. Spot the vendored folder(s) under `<code-dir>` (e.g. `application/libs/`). Committed
   **asset/sprite dirs** are the same kind of noise — bundled UI images (jQuery-UI/colorbox
   sprites, e.g. `extensions/backend/assets/images/`) aren't code but graphify still scans them;
   exclude them the same way.
2. Drop a `.graphifyignore` at the scan root (gitignore syntax, honored by default):
   ```
   # Vendored / third-party code + bundled assets — not our architecture, noise in the graph
   libs/
   ```
3. Rebuild with the CLI refresh plus `--force` — a narrower corpus is a *smaller* graph,
   which trips the shrink guard (#479):
   `GRAPHIFY_OUT="$PWD/graphify-out" graphify update --force "$PWD/<code-dir>"`.
   Do NOT delete `graphify-out/graph.json` first (see "Refreshing after a code change" in
   `IMPLEMENTATION_FLOW.md`: the CLI would rebuild
   it undirected and drop the doc nodes).
4. Verify: grep the vendored library's distinctive class name in the new `graph.json` — it
   should return only first-party code that *uses* the library (e.g. your own `FacebookManager`),
   never the library's own classes.
