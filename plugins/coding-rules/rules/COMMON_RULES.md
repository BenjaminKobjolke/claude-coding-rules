# Common Rules (All Languages)

These rules apply to all projects, regardless of language. Language-specific rules live in the
corresponding `*_RULES.md` files.

---

## Keep CODING_RULES.md in Sync

When working on a project, copy all relevant rules into the project's `CODING_RULES.md` file
(project root). The project's `CLAUDE.md` carries only a small versioned pointer block that
mandates reading `CODING_RULES.md` before code work — never the full rules, and never an
`@import` of `CODING_RULES.md` (imports auto-expand into context every turn).

- Always include all rules from `COMMON_RULES.md` and `AI_RULES.md`
- Also include applicable language-specific, project-type, and supplemental rule files
  (see `PROJECT_TYPES.md` for the project-type overview)
- Include optional addon rule files only when the user has opted in to that addon
- If applicability is unclear, ask the user which rules to include
- Include each source file's `# Version` block with its copied rules
- If `CODING_RULES.md` already exists, compare each source file's version with the corresponding
  copied rule block and update only stale or unversioned blocks, keeping the result deduplicated
- If `CLAUDE.md` contains inlined rule blocks or coding-rule `@import` lines from an earlier run,
  migrate that content into `CODING_RULES.md` and leave only the pointer block in `CLAUDE.md`

---

## Use Objects for Related Values

When multiple related values must be passed between classes or methods, bundle them into a
dedicated object (e.g., DTO/Settings/Config) instead of passing many parameters. This improves
readability, reduces call-site churn, and makes changes safer.

---

## No Bag-of-Keys Returns at Module Boundaries

When a public method on a manager/repository/service returns data that crosses a module
boundary, the return type must be a typed object (DTO, value object, or domain model) — never
a raw associative array indexed by string keys. Plain `array` returns silently swallow shape
bugs: a missing key reads as `null`, a list-vs-single mix-up reads as "no data", and renames
go undetected by static analysis.

- **Anti-pattern.** `getSettingsValue(...)` returns `array|null`; callers do `$result['value']`,
  `$result['type']`. A consumer mis-indexes `$result[0]['value']` after a refactor; nothing
  flags the change. The function silently returns `null` and downstream defaults take over.
- **Correct pattern.** Return a class — `getSettingsElement(...): ?SettingsElement`. The class
  exposes `getValue()`, `getType()`, `exists()`. Typed, autocompleted, statically checked;
  renames propagate via the IDE.
- **Lists vs single must be obvious from the type and the name.** `getThing(): ?Thing`
  (zero or one) vs `getThings(): ThingList` or `iterable<Thing>`. Never overload the same
  return type to mean both.
- **Distinguish absent from empty.** `null` from a lookup means "not found"; an empty
  collection means "found, but had nothing". A typed return makes this contract explicit;
  a bag-of-keys array hides it.
- **JSON-decoded blobs are arrays too.** The rule applies equally to `json_decode($column, true)`
  results that cross a module boundary — wrap them in a value object before they leave the
  layer that owns the schema.
- **Internal helpers may stay arrays.** This rule targets *public* API on managers and the
  boundary where a domain abstraction starts. Pure-private array juggling inside a single
  method is fine.

---

## Reuse Existing Models Before Inventing Array Shapes

Before designing a new return type or DTO, search the codebase for an existing domain class
that already owns the same data. Most "should this be a DTO?" decisions are actually
"is there already a `Contest` / `User` / `Order` class that should absorb this method?"

- Grep for the table name, the primary key, and the most distinctive column.
- If a model already exists with a constructor that accepts the row shape, use it — don't
  invent a parallel array shape that mirrors the same columns.
- Adding a `getXxxObject()` alongside a legacy `getXxxData()` is acceptable as a migration
  step; keep both only until consumers are migrated, then delete the array-returning version.

---

## Tests Pin the Shape Before the Refactor

When converting a bag-of-keys return to a typed object, write a **characterization test
first** that locks the current behavior using the existing API, run it green against the
unrefactored code, and then refactor. The same test (or a renamed-but-equivalent one) must
remain green afterward.

This converts "I think the new object preserves behavior" into "the test proves it." Pair
with the "Test-Driven Development" rule below — characterization tests are TDD applied to
refactors instead of new features.

---

## Test-Driven Development for Features and Bug Fixes

Follow TDD when implementing features or fixing bugs:

1. Write tests first
2. Run the tests and confirm they fail
3. Implement the change or fix
4. Run the tests again and confirm they pass

---

## Integration Tests

Every project must include integration tests in addition to unit tests. Integration tests verify that
components work correctly together and catch issues that unit tests alone cannot detect.

---

## Test Runner Scripts

Every project must provide the following batch files in the `tools/` directory:

- `tools/run_tests.bat` — runs unit tests
- `tools/run_integration_tests.bat` — runs integration tests

These scripts ensure a consistent way to execute tests across environments.

---

## Prefer Type-Safe Values

Use strong, explicit types instead of loosely typed or stringly typed values (e.g., typed DTOs,
enums, generics, typed settings). This ensures mistakes are caught at compile time or by tests
early in development.

---

## String Constants

Centralize string constants in a dedicated module/class. Do not scatter raw strings across
the codebase. Use language-appropriate patterns for constants and reuse them consistently.

---

## Reusable Tooling

Before building project-specific infrastructure scripts (audits, codemods,
build helpers, lint checks, etc.) for a project, check the matching
language's `*_setup_files/` folder under this `coding-rules` repo for an
existing equivalent. If found, copy or reference it. If not:

1. Build the script in the project and prove it on real data.
2. Copy the script into the right `*_setup_files/tools/` folder.
3. Document it in that language's `*_RULES.md` so the next project picks
   it up automatically.

This keeps cross-project tooling consistent and prevents the same script
from being re-invented in every new project.

---

## README.md is Mandatory

Every project must have a `README.md` file in the root directory. It should include:

- Project name and description
- Installation/setup instructions
- Usage examples
- Dependencies and requirements

---

## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

Avoid code duplication. If the same logic appears in multiple places, extract it into a
reusable function, class, module, or utility.

- Duplicate code is harder to maintain and leads to bugs
- Extract shared logic into helpers or base abstractions
- Use constants for repeated values

---

## Derive, Don't Duplicate — One Value Owns the Derivation

When one value strictly determines another, pass only the determinant and derive the rest —
never thread both side-by-side through call sites, constructors, and events. Two co-varying
parameters are a functional dependency in disguise; passing both lets them drift into illegal
combinations.

- **Anti-pattern.** `createLog(ActionCategory $cat, ActionType $type)` threaded through ~10
  sites. Nothing stops a caller passing `category: email, type: lead.created`.
- **Correct pattern.** The richer type owns the relationship: `ActionType::category()` returns
  its `ActionCategory` via a single exhaustive `match`. Call sites pass only `ActionType`;
  category is always derived, so a mismatch is unconstructable.
- **Apply when** one value *determines* the other (a true functional dependency).
- **Don't apply when** the relationship is many-to-many or genuinely independent — forcing a
  derivation that doesn't exist couples things that should stay separate.
- **Keep derivation cheap and pure** — a getter/match, no DB or IO behind a call that looks free.
- **Keep the mapping exhaustive** (enum + exhaustive match) so a new case cannot silently skip
  its derived value.

This is Single Source of Truth applied to parameters, and a form of "make illegal states
unrepresentable." Pairs with "Prefer Type-Safe Values" and "Self-Describing Classes".

---

## Keep It Simple (KISS)

Prefer the simplest solution that actually works. Complicated logic for a simple result must be
kept to a minimum — a future maintainer (or you, at 3am) has to understand it.

- **YAGNI.** Don't build for a need that isn't here yet: no interface with a single
  implementation, no factory for one product, no config for a value that never changes.
- **Boring over clever.** Clever is what someone decodes later. The obvious solution wins.
- **Deletion over addition.** The shortest working change is usually the right one.
- Pairs with "Don't Repeat Yourself" and "No God Classes" — simplicity is what those rules
  are protecting.

---

## Confirm Dependency Versions

Before adding any new package or library, confirm the version with the user to ensure we use
up-to-date dependencies.

- Do not assume which version to use
- Ask the user to verify the latest stable version
- Avoid outdated packages that may have security vulnerabilities or missing features

---

## Error Handling & Logging Strategy

Every project must have a centralized error handler rather than ad-hoc try/catch blocks scattered
throughout the codebase.

- Use structured logging (not `print`/`console.log`/`echo`)
- Log at appropriate levels: debug, info, warning, error
- Include context in log messages (module name, operation, relevant IDs)

---

## Centralized Logger — Single Off Switch

Route all logging through one dedicated logger class/module. Never call the language's
built-in output directly for logging (`print`, `console.log`, `echo`, `Debug.Log`,
`System.out`). Code calls the project logger; the project logger wraps the underlying sink.

- **One toggle.** Because every log goes through one place, logging can be turned off,
  level-filtered, or redirected (file, console, remote) from a single config flag — without
  touching call sites. Example: a `logEnabled` / `logLevel` setting the logger checks once.
- **Levels live in the logger.** Callers pass a level (debug/info/warning/error); the logger
  decides what is emitted based on central config. Callers never branch on "should I log?".
- **Wrap, don't scatter.** Built-in calls (`print`, framework loggers, `Debug.Log`) appear
  in exactly one file — the logger implementation. Everywhere else imports the logger.
- **Language specifics** still apply (e.g. Unity `[Conditional]` stripping, Flutter `logger`
  package, Python `logging`) — but they are configured inside the central logger, not at
  call sites.

The logger's name is fixed per language so it is the same known type in every project (see each
`*_RULES.md` for details):

| Language      | Class / export     | File                |
|---------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Python        | `AppLogger`        | `app_logger.py`     |
| PHP           | `Logger`           | `Logger.php`        |
| Dart/Flutter  | `AppLogger`        | `app_logger.dart`   |
| Kotlin        | `AppLogger`        | `AppLogger.kt`      |
| C# (plain)    | `AppLogger`        | `AppLogger.cs`      |
| Unity C#      | `GameLog` (static) | `GameLog.cs`        |
| Svelte/JS/TS  | `logger` (export)  | `logger.ts`         |
| Arduino       | `Log`              | `Log.h` / `Log.cpp` |

---

## Input Validation at Boundaries

Always validate data at system boundaries — API inputs, user input, file uploads, external service
responses.

- Never trust external data; validate before processing
- Use language-appropriate validation libraries (e.g., Pydantic, Zod, FluentValidation)
- Fail fast with clear error messages when validation fails

---

## Maximum File Length — 300 Lines

Split files when they exceed 300 lines to keep code navigable during fast iteration.

- Extract classes, functions, or components into separate modules
- Group related extractions logically (by domain, not by type)
- Exceptions: generated files, configuration files, test files with many similar cases

---

## Naming Conventions

Be consistent within a project. Follow these defaults unless the language or framework dictates
otherwise:

- Files: `snake_case` (or language convention, e.g., `PascalCase` for C# classes)
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Functions/methods: language convention (`snake_case` for Python/PHP, `camelCase` for Dart/JS/C#)
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Variables: language convention (`snake_case` for Python/PHP, `camelCase` for Dart/JS/C#)

---

## Comments Explain Why, Not What

Comment intent and non-obvious reasoning — not a restatement of the code. Good names carry the
*what*; comments carry the *why*.

- **Anti-pattern.** `i++ // increment i`. Redundant comments add noise and rot the moment the
  code changes.
- **Correct pattern.** Document *why* a workaround exists, why a non-obvious algorithm was
  chosen, or a constraint that isn't visible locally (`// API rejects batches > 500`).
- Prefer self-documenting code (clear names, small functions) over a comment that compensates
  for unclear code — see "Naming Conventions" and "Keep It Simple".
- Document the purpose of each module/class at its top.
- Keep comments in sync with the code; delete stale ones rather than letting them mislead.

---

## Security Baseline

Every project must follow these minimum security practices:

- Never commit secrets (`.env`, API keys, credentials, private keys)
- Escape output to prevent XSS/injection attacks
- Use parameterized queries or ORM-provided methods — never concatenate user input into queries
- Validate and sanitize all user input at system boundaries
- Keep dependencies updated to avoid known vulnerabilities

---

## No Hardcoded Environment Values

Never hardcode environment-specific values in code — filesystem paths, hostnames, IP addresses,
ports, base URLs. They differ across machines and environments and make code non-portable.

- **Anti-pattern.** `connect("192.168.1.50:5432")`, `open("C:\\Users\\bob\\data\\out.json")`.
- **Correct pattern.** Read them from the project's central config (the config class each
  `*_RULES.md` already mandates), with a committed `.example` template documenting every key.
- Distinct from the secrets rule above: this is about **portability** (runs anywhere), not
  secrecy. A non-secret hostname still belongs in config, not in code.

---

## No God Classes

A class that handles too many responsibilities becomes fragile, hard to test, and impossible to
reuse. Keep each class focused on a single purpose.

- **Warning signs**: more than 5 public methods, more than 4 constructor dependencies, or methods that span unrelated domains (e.g., a class that validates input, queries the database, and sends emails)
- Split by responsibility: extract collaborators (e.g., a `Validator`, a `Repository`, a `Notifier`) rather than piling logic into one class
- If you struggle to name the class without using "Manager", "Handler", "Service", or "Helper" as a catch-all, it likely does too much
- This complements the 300-line file rule — a short class can still be a god class if it owns too many concerns

---

## Self-Describing Classes

When behavior depends on which fields or properties a class has — such as search, serialization,
display, validation, or auditing — the class itself must declare those fields through a contract
(interface, abstract method, attribute/annotation, or introspection pattern). Never hardcode field
lists in consuming code.

- **Anti-pattern**: A search service contains a hardcoded list of fields to index for each entity;
  adding a new field requires updating every consumer manually
- **Correct pattern**: Each class implements a contract (e.g., `GetSearchableFields()`,
  `GetDisplayColumns()`) that returns its own relevant fields, so adding a field in one place
  automatically propagates everywhere
- This applies to any cross-cutting concern that operates over class fields: search, filtering,
  export, form generation, diffing, logging, etc.
- Combine with compile-time checks where the language supports them (e.g., sealed interfaces,
  exhaustive matching) to ensure new fields cannot be silently ignored

---

## Inject Collaborators, Don't Fold Dependencies In

Composition reuse comes in two shapes, and they differ sharply in how much coupling they add to
the reusing class. **Folding** a helper into a class (mixin, trait, multiple inheritance, copy-in
include) merges *all of the helper's own dependencies* into that class — reuse five such helpers
and every one of their imports is now the host's coupling. **Injecting** a collaborator adds a
single dependency: the collaborator, which is built once and shared as a hub.

Prefer injected collaborators. Reserve fold-in reuse for helpers that are stateless and carry no
dependencies of their own.

- **Anti-pattern**: A controller reuses five behavior mixins/traits; each brings its own service,
  DTO, and constant imports, so the controller transitively depends on a few dozen things and is
  hard to test in isolation.
- **Correct pattern**: Extract that behavior into a collaborator object injected via the
  constructor. The controller depends on the collaborator; the collaborator is reused across many
  controllers as a shared, well-tested hub.

### Inject services; never instantiate one inside a method

Constructing a service with `new` (or the language equivalent) inside a method hides the
dependency from the class's public contract and makes it impossible to substitute in a test. Pass
collaborators in through the constructor.

- **Anti-pattern**: A method does `helper = new EmailPreparer(); helper.prepare(...)`. Nothing in
  the class signature reveals the dependency, and no test can replace it.
- **Correct pattern**: Inject `EmailPreparer` once; the method calls the injected instance.

### Collapse config-callback swarms into one value object

When a base class pulls its configuration from the subclass through many small overridable getters
that the subclass fills in one-line-each, each getter is a separate touch-point and the wiring is
spread across dozens of methods. Bundle the related values into a single config object built once
and handed to the base (see **Use Objects for Related Values**). This also keeps such classes off
the wrong side of **No God Classes**.

- **Anti-pattern**: A subclass implements `getSendEndpoint()`, `getSendSuccessKey()`,
  `getSendFailureRedirect()`, and a dozen more one-line getters, each naming one constant.
- **Correct pattern**: The subclass builds one `SendConfig` value object once; the base reads its
  fields.
